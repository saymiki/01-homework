<strong> USER STORY: </strong>

* AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

<strong> ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA </STRONG>    

* GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

<STRONG> DESCRIPTION </strong>

* I refactored the given index.html file without changing the original code function. HTML elements were added and replaced pre-existing elements to add accessibility to users and to sort html structure in a logical way for future developers.

<STRONG> KEY CHANGES </strong>

* Added ALT elements for accessibility for those utilizing screen readers

* Added figure elements to identify images and later on added captions for further eccessibility

* Replaced div elements to more semantic elements such as "header", "footer", "main", and "article", for more logical progression in the HTML structure 

* Commented my changes to the structure for future developers

<STRONG> DEPLOYMENT </strong>
